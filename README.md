# BulletHell

By Santiago R. D'Angelo and Alejandro Caffarena.

This is a bullet hell engine we made for our programming final, with a heavy emphasis on S.O.L.I.D. 
The purpose of this was to create code that would be as clean and flexible as possible. 

For this we used several systems, among them:
  FACTORY: Proyectiles, loot, particles and enemies
  MVC: Player Character
  DECORATOR: Player Upgrades
  FLYWEIGHT: Enemy and Player stats
 
Feel free to explore the code and judge it on your own merits.
